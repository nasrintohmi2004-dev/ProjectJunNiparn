// SpawnPoint
// Marks a place in a scene where the player should appear after walking through a
// door. Each door says which Spawn Point Id to use, and the SceneLoader moves the
// player to the matching SpawnPoint in the newly loaded scene.
//
// Put this on: an empty GameObject placed where the player should stand.
// Assign in Inspector: "Spawn Point Id" (a short name that a door will point to,
//   for example "FromLevel2" or "MainEntrance").
